# Evidence Base for Nourish Goal Tracks

This document anchors Nourish's recommendations in nutrition and medical literature. The app should present these as supportive food-pattern nudges, **not treatment claims** and **not calorie prescriptions**.

## Product Safety and Scope

- Nourish is educational and behavior-supportive, not a diagnostic tool.
- In-app copy should avoid cure language (e.g., "fix", "heal", "reverse").
- Pregnancy-related guidance should include a reminder to consult a clinician for supplements and individualized care.

## Goal: Glowy Skin

### What to track
- Vitamin C-rich produce
- Carotenoid-rich produce (orange/red/dark green)
- Omega-3 sources
- Protein anchors

### Why this is reasonable
1. **Higher fruit/vegetable intake can improve skin coloration and perceived healthy appearance** over weeks, likely from carotenoids.
2. **Low-glycemic-load patterns may improve acne severity** in some populations.

## Goal: Healthy Gut

### What to track
- Fiber-rich foods
- Prebiotic foods
- Fermented foods
- Polyphenol-rich plants

### Why this is reasonable
1. **Dietary fiber is central to microbiome health** and short-chain fatty acid production.
2. **Fermented food intake can increase microbiome diversity and lower inflammatory markers** in controlled feeding contexts.

## Goal: Pregnancy Prep

### What to track
- Folate-rich foods
- Iron-rich foods
- Choline sources
- Omega-3 sources

### Why this is reasonable
1. **Periconception folic acid lowers neural tube defect risk**; dietary folate patterns can reinforce this habit.
2. **Iron sufficiency before and during pregnancy is important** given risks from maternal iron deficiency anemia.
3. **Choline and DHA are commonly emphasized for fetal neurodevelopment** in prenatal nutrition guidance.

## UX Rules Derived from Evidence + Eating Disorder Safety

- Track **food/nutrient presence and variety**, not calories.
- Use affirmative language: "add", "include", "build", "support".
- Do not show red deficit states or "remaining" numbers.
- Offer substitutions and additions when a nutrient category is low.
- Keep symptom check-ins optional and non-judgmental.

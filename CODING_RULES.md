# Coding Rules (Non-negotiable)

- Do NOT implement calorie tracking or display calories anywhere.
- Do NOT implement weight tracking, fasting timers, or macro targets.
- Avoid “remaining” numbers and red/yellow warning states.
- Use neutral language (no good/bad foods, no cheat language).
- Use additive suggestions: “add one” rather than restriction.
